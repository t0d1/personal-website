My personal website built using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io).
You're on it right now but I though it might as well link [the source code](https://github.com/t0d1/personal-website) in the projects list.

Since I don't know much about Go I used one of the themes provided on the gohugo website called ["Hugo Tania"](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tania/) and
modified as well as simplified it to my liking. I find the Go syntax to be very confusing at times but since I only need
a few basic page types it is totally worth it.

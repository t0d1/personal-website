Hello, my name is Tommy and I'm a Junior IT Consultant working for on of the big banks
in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I've studied computer science and media (Medieninformatik)
at the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences in Wiesbaden and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 2020.

In my free time I like to look into new frameworks and technologies to stay up to date.
I also try out a lot of different techniques to improve my productivity and efficiency, 
because it is a fun way to learn about how my brain actually learns best.

If I'm not in front of my computer you may instead find me in front of a microphone doing
voice over and voice acting stuff (I'm not willing to call it "work") or out and about
exploring nature. Then there are also books, which I prefer over movies any day.

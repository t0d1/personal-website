      <description>Introduction I recently bought the &amp;ldquo;Atreus&amp;rdquo; from Keyboardio after wanting to dive into customizable, ergonomic keyboards for a while.

While the software (v.0.8.4) provides some great features already, I wanted even more customization options for my layout to be more suitable for the needs of a German software developer, so I downloaded the Arduino IDE, added the &amp;ldquo;Kaleidoscope Keyboards&amp;rdquo; plugin and got to work.</description>

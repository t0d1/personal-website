      <description>My personal website built using the Hugo static site generator. You&amp;rsquo;re on it right now but I though it might as well link the source code in the projects list.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Go I used one of the themes provided on the gohugo website called &amp;ldquo;Hugo Tania&amp;rdquo; and modified as well as simplified it to my liking. I find the Go syntax to be very confusing at times but since I only need a few basic page types it is totally worth it.</description>
